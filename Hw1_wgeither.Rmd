## Problem 1
Primers Done

## Problem 2
Saved to Github

a) I got my undergrad in mathematics with a minor in stats, so I had a fair amount of exopsure and use in R. For the past 2 years I worked as a Data Analyst at an Ad-tech company where I primarily used Python, SQL, and C#. That being said, in this class I would love to:
 - Refamiliarize myself with linear regression & ANOVA in R
 - Learn about parallel computing and how to connect to the university's supercomputer
 - Learn about Monte Carlo procedures and Power as I'm not sure if this was covered in my undergrad curriculum
 
 b)
 
Binomial Distribution:
 
$$(1)\text{ }P(X=x|n,p) = {{n}\choose{x}} \cdot p^x \cdot (1-p)^{n-x}; x=0,1,2,...,n;\text{ } 0\leq p\leq1$$

Discrete Uniform:

$$(2)\text{ }P(X=x|N) = \frac{1}{N}; x=0,1,2,...,N;\text{ } N\in \mathbb{N}$$

Exponential Distribution:

$$(3)\text{ }f(x|\beta) = \frac{1}{\beta}e^{-x/\beta},\text{ }0\leq x \leq \infty,\text{ } \beta > 0$$
